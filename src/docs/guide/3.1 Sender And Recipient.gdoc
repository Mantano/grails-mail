h3. Recipients

The DSL provides @to@, @cc@ and @bcc@ methods that allow you to set one or more address values for these recipient types.

{code}
sendMail {
    to "someone@org.com"
    cc "manager@org.com"
    bcc "employee1\@org.com", "employee2\@org.com"
    â€¦
}
{code}

All methods take one or more string values that are an email address using the syntax of "RFC822":http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc822.txt. Typical address syntax is of the form @"user\@host.domain"@ or @"Personal Name <user\@host.domain>"@.
